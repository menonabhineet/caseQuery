{"query": "What are the termination conditions in these agreements?", "reference_answer": "The agreements generally allow termination for cause and, in some cases, for convenience. Termination for cause usually includes material breach, failure to pay, violation of confidentiality, or illegal conduct by a party. Many contracts also permit termination upon insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar financial distress events. Some agreements further allow either party to terminate without cause by giving a specified period of prior written notice."}
{"query": "What are the confidentiality obligations of the parties?", "reference_answer": "Each party must keep the other party's confidential information secret, use it only for purposes of performing the agreement, and not disclose it to third parties except on a strict need-to-know basis under similar confidentiality obligations. The obligations typically survive termination of the agreement and require the receiving party to return or destroy confidential materials upon request, subject to standard exceptions such as information already public, independently developed, or lawfully obtained from a third party."}
{"query": "How is intellectual property ownership allocated between the parties under these agreements?", "reference_answer": "Pre-existing intellectual property remains the sole property of the party that owned it before the agreement. Newly created IP is often owned either by the party that develops it or by the customer, depending on the contract; in some agreements, the provider assigns all IP in deliverables to the customer while retaining ownership of background technology, tools, and know-how. The non-owning party typically receives a limited license to use the IP only as necessary to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under the agreement."}
{"query": "What limitations of liability apply to the parties?", "reference_answer": "The agreements usually exclude liability for indirect, consequential, special, or punitive damages, such as loss of profits or business interruption. Total direct damages are often capped at a specified amount, commonly a multiple of fees paid or payable under the agreement over a defined period. Some carve-outs apply so that the cap does not limit liability for breaches of confidentiality, infringement of intellectual property, willful misconduct, or indemnity obligations."}
{"query": "What indemnification obligations do the parties have?", "reference_answer": "Typically, the provider agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the customer against third-party claims alleging that the services, products, or deliverables infringe intellectual property rights or cause bodily injury or property damage. The customer may also indemnify the provider for claims arising from the customer's misuse of the services, violation of law, or use of customer data. Indemnity obligations often require prompt notice of the claim, control of the defense by the indemnifying party, and cooperation by the indemnified party."}
{"query": "What is the governing law and jurisdiction specified in these agreements?", "reference_answer": "Each agreement designates a specific jurisdiction's laws, commonly the laws of a particular U.S. state such as Delaware, New York, or California, as the governing law, excluding its conflict-of-law rules. The contracts typically specify that any disputes must be brought in the state or federal courts located in the chosen venue, and the parties consent to the personal jurisdiction and exclusive venue of those courts. Some agreements also include waiver of jury trial or alternative dispute resolution provisions."}
{"query": "What payment terms and invoicing procedures apply under these agreements?", "reference_answer": "The agreements generally require the customer to pay fees within a defined period after the invoice date, often 30 days, sometimes 45 or 60. Payments are usually made in a specified currency and may be subject to late payment interest if not timely paid. The provider may suspend services for material non-payment after notice and an opportunity to cure. Some contracts also cover taxes, stating that the customer is responsible for applicable sales or use taxes, and address disputes over invoices, which must be raised within a set time window."}
{"query": "How do these agreements address assignment and change of control?", "reference_answer": "Most agreements prohibit assignment by either party without the prior written consent of the other, except that a party may freely assign the agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all of its assets or business. Any prohibited assignment is typically void. Some contracts require the assigning party to provide written notice of a permitted assignment or change of control, and allow the non-assigning party to terminate the agreement if the assignee is a direct competitor or presents increased legal or financial risk."}
{"query": "What restrictions do the agreements place on non-compete, non-solicitation, or exclusivity?", "reference_answer": "The agreements may restrict a party from soliciting or hiring the other party's employees for a defined period, often 6 to 24 months, except in cases of general solicitations not targeted at the other party. Some contracts include exclusivity provisions that prevent the customer from engaging competing providers or require the provider to refrain from working with direct competitors in a specific territory or market segment. Any non-compete or non-solicit clauses are usually time-limited and subject to applicable law on enforceability."}
{"query": "How are disputes to be resolved under these agreements?", "reference_answer": "Disputes are often subject to a tiered resolution process beginning with good-faith negotiations between the parties' designated representatives. If negotiations fail within a specified time, disputes may proceed to mediation or binding arbitration before a recognized arbitral forum, or be litigated in designated courts. The agreements may also allocate attorneys' fees, allowing the prevailing party to recover reasonable costs, and can include waivers of jury trial or class action participation where permitted by law."}
